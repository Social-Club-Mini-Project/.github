## INTRODUCTION
In this project we considered a social club app for our University MTi. We want to give our community (MTI students) a way to communicate each other by a spatial app ,so we made a small version of an app call MTI social club.

Technologies/Techniques
We used deferent tools to complect this app in a web version, starting with the Database by using Microsoft SQL Server to save and modify the data of our users, for the front end we used React program base typescript and of course with HTML and CSS ,for delivering the data from our Database to the front end we used ASP API.
